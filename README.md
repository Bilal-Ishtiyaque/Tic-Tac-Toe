a Tic Tac Toe ❌⭕️ game that I built from scratch using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. It's a great way for beginners to learn about logic building. Here's a glimpse into technical aspects and principles behind this little game:

🧠 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰: I used JavaScript to create the game's core logic. Each move, whether it's an "X" or "O," is handled by JavaScript functions. I've implemented the game's win and draw conditions using arrays and loops to check for possible combinations.

🔀 𝗥𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗫 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗢: To make the game interesting, I've added a random feature that determines whether "X" or "O" starts the game.

🎯 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: The game checks for winning conditions after each move, ensuring that it's responsive to player actions. It displays a message and plays a sound when a player wins.

🤝 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝘁: A play button that initiates the game & a reset button for restarting the game after it's finished.

🚪 𝗘𝘅𝗶𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: I've included an exit button with a confirmation dialog, preventing accidental exits and letting you resume the game where you left off.

🔊 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀: Sound effects for clicking, winning, draw, restarting and also a party popper GIF to celebrate the winning.

📏 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 : JavaScript dynamically adjusts the game container's dimensions based on the user's device. It constantly monitors the window's dimensions and recalculates the container's width and height to fit within the limits I have defined.
